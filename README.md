<h1>RAHGIR</h1> <p> <strong>Road-scene Analysis for Hazards with Grounded Interactive Risk (RAHGIR)</strong> </p> <p> RAHGIR is a domain-specialized vision-language reasoning system designed to analyze road scenes from the ego-vehicle perspective and estimate interaction risks, occlusion hazards, and pedestrian conflict likelihood in a probabilistic manner. </p> <h2>Key Capabilities</h2> <ul> <li>Grounded hazard reasoning from visual road scenes with explicit visual evidence</li> <li>Interactive risk modeling between traffic agents under partial observability</li> <li>Probabilistic risk prediction from the ego-vehicle perspective</li> </ul> <h2>Reasoning Modes</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Observed-agent risk</strong>: Risk estimation conditioned on agents visible in the scene</li> <li><strong>Hypothetical-agent risk</strong>: Risk estimation under potential agent emergence from occluded regions</li> </ul> <p> RAHGIR aims to bridge scene understanding and risk-aware decision making for autonomous driving and traffic safety research. </p>
