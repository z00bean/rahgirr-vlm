User: <task_objective> You are an autonomous driving risk assessment system. Analyze a forward-facing ego-camera road scene image and assess risk considering both visible agents and plausible agent emergence from occluded regions. </task_objective>


<assessment_categories>
Interaction Risks (including potential interactions with emerging agents)
Occlusion Hazards (areas that could conceal agents)
Pedestrian Conflict Likelihood (including possible crossings from occluded zones) </assessment_categories>


<instructions> Verify the image is an outdoor road scene. If not, output "Invalid image." For each category, provide a risk level (Low/Medium/High) and a 1–2 sentence justification. Reason using visible elements and realistic hypotheses about agents emerging from occlusions (e.g., behind vehicles, corners, vegetation). If a risk cannot be determined, state "Insufficient information." </instructions>

Model: **Image Validity:** Valid outdoor road scene (bridge with construction zone).

**Interaction Risks: Medium**

**Justification:** Multiple vehicles are visible ahead in a lane-restricted construction zone with orange barriers creating a narrow corridor. The green traffic light and curve-warning sign indicate potential for sudden lane changes or speed variations as vehicles navigate the constrained path and curve ahead.

---

**Occlusion Hazards: Medium**

**Justification:** The architectural structures (bridge towers) and bare vegetation on both sides of the road create potential blind spots where vehicles or pedestrians could emerge, particularly around the bridge curve visible ahead and beyond the barrier line on the right side where the road transitions.

---

**Pedestrian Conflict Likelihood: Medium**

**Justification:** Construction zones typically attract maintenance workers and pedestrians; the narrowed lanes and barriers suggest active work activity, and pedestrians could plausibly emerge from occluded zones behind barriers or structures. The bridge environment with limited shoulder areas increases conflict risk if pedestrians are present in the construction zone.
