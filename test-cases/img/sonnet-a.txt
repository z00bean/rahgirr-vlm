Image Validity: Valid outdoor road scene

Interaction Risks: High + Justification: Active construction zone with orange traffic barrels creating lane restrictions and merging traffic from the left, plus vehicles visible in adjacent lanes requiring careful navigation through the work zone.

Occlusion Hazards: Medium + Justification: The concrete bridge pillars and structure create visual obstructions that could conceal vehicles or maintenance workers in the construction area. Limited visibility around the bridge infrastructure increases uncertainty about potential hazards.

Pedestrian Conflict Likelihood: Medium + Justification: While this appears to be a bridge with limited pedestrian access, construction zones often involve workers who may need to cross or work near traffic lanes. The work zone increases the possibility of worker presence in or near the roadway.
